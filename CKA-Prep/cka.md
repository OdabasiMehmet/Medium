# How to pass CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) Exam

I passed the CKA exam in December,2022 in my first attempt and have received many questions with regards to exam preparation. Instead of answering questions one by one, I decided to share my experience through a medium story. I hope that it will help you pass the exam in your first attempt.

CKA certificate is offered by Linux Foundation and is considered one of the top certificates in the DevOps field. Unlike many other exams that are composed of Multiple Choice questions, CKA is solely a task based exam. There are no test questions, no options to choose from, no fill in the blanks. You are provided with an infrastructure and you will be asked to complete tasks within that infrastructure. Therefore, you really need to know what you are doing in order to pass the exam. 

# Kubernetes Course

First of all, if you are new to Kubernetes, Docker or container technology, do not rush into the exam directly. Master the basics first and try to understand how Kubernetes work. There are many courses to choose from in terms of Kubernetes basics. You can choose courses from Udemy or Coursera as well as Linkedin Learning. You might as well enroll in a bootcamp. All of them works just fine to learn the basics.

# CKA Course
Once you are good with the basics, I recommend you to take Mumshad Mannambeth's Udemy Course. I took the course and really benefited from it. In addition to the conten, the course provides free lab sessions on KodeKloud platform which is very similar to the CKA exam environment, so you will have lots of hands on experince before the exam. The course also offers mock exams.

Also, you must definitely check out killerkoda website. Killerkoda is free to use and the website offers interactive environments with multiple scenarios. You can log in, work on a scenario and restart it as many times as you want until you master the subjects.
# killer.sh

Finally, when you register for the exam, you are provided with two sessions of killer.sh exam simulator.
1. The sessions are accessible for 36 hours each (36+36).
2. Start the simulator around noon, so that you will have a chance to work until the following night.
3. Once you start the simulator, you will have 36 hours to utilize the exam simulator. You can restart as many times as you can, but my advice to you is to act as if you are taking the real exam and try to finish it in two hours. After two hours, check your work and grade to see how you do. Then check for solutions, compare your work and understand which subjects you must improve
4. killer.sh exams are way more difficult than the actual exams. So, if you fail to get a good grade in your first attempt, do not panic.
5. Restart the exam simulator and try to finish more tasks in the required timeframe than your first attempt.
6. Make sure, that you do the full exam at least three times.
7. Do not immediately take the second session unless your real exam is due in three days. If there will be a time gap, you may get rusty so schedule the second session within three days of the exams date. If you start at noon again, you can finish your 36 hours the day before the exam.
8. The second session offers the same tasks so do not expect different tasks. But in essence, once you understand how to do a task, you can easily manage similar tasks.
